# Kinetic Analysis Toolkit (KAT)

`KAT` is a Python-based graphical user interface (GUI) application for analyzing enzyme kinetic data. It supports both classical models( **Michaelis-Menten** and **Hill** 
models) and complex models (**Monod-Wyman-Changeux** and **Koshland-Nemethy-Filmer** models), outputting kinetic parameters (*e.g.* *K<sub>M</sub>*, *V<sub>max</sub>*, and *k<sub>cat</sub>* for Michaelis-Menten) along 
with visual plots of your data. KAT is designed for experimental scientists who want a quick, user-friendly tool to interpret enzyme kinetics from absorbance or fluorescence 
data stored in CSV files.

## Features

- GUI-based interface (built with PySide6)
- Input CSV files containing absorbance or fluorescence data
- Can accept both replica and mutant data, treating each differently depending on the application
- Supports **Michaelis-Menten**, **Hill**, **Monod-Wyman-Changeux**, and **Koshland-Nemethy-Filmer** kinetic models
- Outputs:
  - Kinetic parameters based on the model chosen including, *V<sub>max</sub>*, *K<sub>M</sub>*, *n*, and many others for complex models
- Automatically fits nonlinear models using SciPy and Sympy
- Displays graph chosen model
- Export plot as both PNG and SVG and parameters to .txt files

## Installation

### Requirements

- Python 3.12+
- PySide6
- Matplotlib
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- SciPy
- Sympy

### Installation Instructions

1. Download the appropriate KAT_{os}.tar.bz2 file from `Releases`
   - [KAT for MacOS](https://github.com/evanj11/KAT/releases/download/v0.1.0-alpha/KAT.dmg)$^\dagger$
   - [KAT for Windows](https://github.com/evanj11/KAT/releases/download/v0.1.1-alpha/KAT.exe)
3. Untar the release and the pre-bundled KAT application should be ready for use
4. On MacOS, use the disk image to install KAT directly to Applications

- Anyone desiring to make changes to the either the GUI or analysis scripts can rebundle the app directly using `pyinstaller KAT.spec`
- Those wishing to run KAT outside of a dedicated app can run `python main.py` in the master directory to access the GUI
- Currently, there is not an option to run the analysis from the command line without the use of the GUI<br />

$^\dagger$ currently only supports Apple Silicon chips (M1 and later)

## Using KAT

Once `KAT` is installed, operating was designed to be as straightforward as possible:

1. Enter a name for the outputted graphs and parameter information in the `Output Filename` block
2. Upload the data CSV file and the blank CSV file (if present)
   - Make sure data is formatted like the following:
  
     | Time Data | Temperature | Max Substrate | Next Subsubstrate | ... |
     | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
     | 00:00:00 |  29C  | raw data   | raw data | ... |
     | 00:01:00 |  29C  | raw data   | raw data | ... |
     | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

4. Select the folder in which you wish to save the outputted data
5. Enter either fluorescence or absorbance from the dropdown menu
   - if absorbance, an additional window will appear where you can input your molar absorptivity 
6. Enter information about the substrate: number of dilutions, dilution factor, and maximum concentration
7. Enter time information, mainly the window with which to compute slopes (default is 10)
   - if you desire, uncheck the `Auto Calculate Linear Range` button to manually select linear range of raw data
8. Finally, select your model it will run!
9. You can now open the graph and kinetic parameters by selecting `Display Graph and Output Values`

## Testing

Simulated enzyme data is provided in the `tests` folder, along with information regarding substrate concentrations.
Simply download the CSV file, then start KAT, following the steps above. 
The file named `important_information.txt` in the `tests` folder contains information regarding the substrate concentrations.
